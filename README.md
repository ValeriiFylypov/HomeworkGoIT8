In this assignment, I will create a structure for a project with a base class for the Shape. This class had to have a method for displaying the name of the shape.
It was necessary to create classes that inherit from Shape - Circle, Quad, etc. - at least five variants.
It was also necessary to create a class that receives a shape through the base class Shape and displays its name.
